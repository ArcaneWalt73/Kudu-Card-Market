2020/03/06, 17:34 - JiGsAw: You can't use the one on lamp ???
2020/03/06, 18:12 - +27 62 244 7280: Not the login but the app itself
2020/03/06, 18:12 - +27 62 244 7280: The one on git is the one we had before the presentation on Monday

2020/03/08, 10:50 - +27 62 244 7280: had assumed that the majority of you guys were going to be busy or late, and it would have been a lot of work if the people present would be wasting time trying to figure out the absentee's code before actually working on the project
2020/03/08, 10:56 - +27 66 251 5712: I'll be there at 12 today
2020/03/08, 10:58 - +27 62 244 7280: So we will be meeting today

2020/03/08, 10:58 - +27 61 676 3118: If 5/6 can make it I don't see why not.

2020/03/16, 13:50 - +27 62 244 7280: Yoshi

2020/03/16, 13:52 - JiGsAw: @27662515712  
Add the public_html folder on your server  side with the php files on git
2020/03/16, 13:53 - +27 66 251 5712: I'll do that later
2020/03/16, 13:53 - JiGsAw: Tshego can I answer that
2020/03/16, 13:53 - JiGsAw: What 😄😄😄
2020/03/16, 13:54 - +27 66 251 5712: Gents let me give you the login details of the server
So you can upload those php files
2020/03/16, 13:57 - +27 66 251 5712: student@146.141.21.166
password : student

Mysql username : tshego
Password :password123
2020/03/16, 13:59 - +27 66 251 5712: If any of you wants more info on the tables

2020/03/16, 14:37 - +27 62 244 7280: Having trouble *
2020/03/16, 14:38 - JiGsAw: Were are you ? 

Are you connected  to wits wifi
2020/03/16, 14:40 - +27 62 244 7280: 🤦‍♂️oooh am at home, yeah it won't work for me
2020/03/16, 14:40 - JiGsAw: Lol 😄😄ahhh  , let's call off whatever  we were doing
2020/03/16, 14:41 - JiGsAw: Unless id  sipho was working  on the android  part I will resume with him
2020/03/16, 14:45 - +27 62 244 7280: 😂😔ahh ok
2020/03/16, 14:47 - JiGsAw: Which part was sipho doing ?
2020/03/16, 14:48 - +27 62 244 7280: The profile and items
2020/03/16, 14:51 - JiGsAw: I'll just be online  till 15:30
2020/03/16, 14:54 - +27 62 244 7280: If the files are complete I will just use my server until wits is open
2020/03/16, 14:55 - +27 62 244 7280: Then will send an update on how it looks and performs
2020/03/16, 14:59 - JiGsAw: When you do so just download  them from git  and don't change the existing  ones 

You can just change them from your machine  to check if they are working
2020/03/16, 15:02 - +27 66 251 5712: Let's also change the names of the branches on github from our names to the function it performs
2020/03/16, 15:05 - +27 62 244 7280: Yoshi
2020/03/16, 15:05 - +27 62 244 7280: I will not push any change to your branches until we decide to merge
2020/03/16, 15:07 - +27 61 676 3118: So for now to get the latest version of the app which branch do we go to?
2020/03/16, 15:09 - +27 62 244 7280: Go to mine or should I merge with master?
2020/03/16, 15:10 - +27 61 676 3118: I will just go to yours.
2020/03/16, 15:10 - +27 62 244 7280: yoshi
2020/03/16, 15:10 - JiGsAw: Ain't we supposed to merge with master branch when that specific  branch passes the test cases
2020/03/16, 15:11 - +27 66 251 5712: I think we'll merge with master once we've written the tests
So everyone must try to write the tests for their part during the holidays
2020/03/16, 15:13 - +27 61 676 3118: @27677770638 In the last file I uploaded I added a method that returns the user's details for when you are building the profile stuff.
2020/03/16, 15:14 - +27 62 244 7280: Yoshi
2020/03/16, 15:15 - JiGsAw: The method will need a php file, right?
2020/03/16, 15:15 - +27 62 244 7280: Should I request that the meeting with Rylan be online considering the current state of wits?
2020/03/16, 15:16 - +27 67 777 0638: For sure,i'll be using that
2020/03/16, 15:17 - +27 67 777 0638: IMG-20200316-WA0021.jpg (file attached)
2020/03/16, 15:18 - +27 67 777 0638: This is my problem when I accept Siya's invitation.Do I just cloned the repo and I'll do a pull request too
2020/03/16, 15:18 - +27 66 251 5712: Guys draw uml diagrams
Giving an outline of the classes you've created
2020/03/16, 15:19 - +27 67 777 0638: Yes,please.
2020/03/16, 15:20 - +27 67 777 0638: I'm done setting up tests and codecov,In another repo though
2020/03/16, 15:22 - +27 66 251 5712: Were you able to get the coverall badges?
2020/03/16, 15:22 - +27 67 777 0638: Yes
2020/03/16, 15:23 - +27 67 777 0638: But I used codecov instead of coveralls
2020/03/16, 15:24 - +27 61 676 3118: No. The login already returns all the data. I just used that
2020/03/16, 15:25 - +27 61 676 3118: Will do
2020/03/16, 15:27 - +27 66 251 5712: I think we can migrate from coveralls to codecov then
2020/03/16, 15:28 - JiGsAw: For the new one , where I checked  the hashed password  if matches  the one entered I just returned  true then false otherwise
2020/03/16, 15:32 - JiGsAw: I can just change  it back
2020/03/16, 15:32 - +27 61 676 3118: Okay  I will change my method when you upload the new php file.
2020/03/16, 15:33 - JiGsAw: It's on git already  
Under php_files branch
2020/03/16, 15:33 - +27 61 676 3118: Cool.
2020/03/16, 15:50 - JiGsAw: @27677770638 
Were you able to upload  the files on git 

Or you still experiencing troubles with the invite .
2020/03/16, 16:43 - +27 67 777 0638: Still experiencing trouble,I'll do a pull request when my code is running
2020/03/18, 12:51 - +27 61 676 3118's security code changed. Tap for more info.
2020/03/23, 20:22 - +27 61 676 3118's security code changed. Tap for more info.
2020/04/06, 20:08 - +27 78 671 1985's security code changed. Tap for more info.
2020/04/14, 17:55 - +27 62 244 7280: Awe gents
2020/04/14, 18:08 - +27 62 244 7280: Considering that all our workings will become online, I wanted to us clear each other's doubt on the events of the next coming weeks. I would like us to formulate a strategy to deal with the work that may concern our group and project
2020/04/15, 17:05 - +27 61 676 3118: Can there be much changes besides having to meet digitally?
2020/04/15, 17:06 - +27 61 676 3118: Perhaps we should wait to see how the course moves forward then discuss possible issues.
2020/04/16, 21:22 - +27 62 244 7280: I believe some roles might change depending on the type of hardware and internet each of us has access to but besides that I don't think there might be other hiccups
2020/04/16, 21:22 - +27 62 244 7280: Yoshi
2020/04/20, 12:36 - +27 67 777 0638: Awe gents,I hope everyone is doing well and is taking care of themselves during this difficult time.

I have taken a decision to deregister and take a gap gap year.
I do have access to a device but I will not be continuing with any academic related activities.
I'll be happy happy to help you guys setup travis and coveralls if you need the help.
Goodluck *Comrades*.
2020/04/21, 17:11 - +27 62 244 7280: Thanks man goodluck to you as well
2020/04/21, 17:16 - +27 62 244 7280: Gents I had communicated with all of y'all regarding the project and it seems we are all keen to continue expect for Sipho

Davis has connection problems but he said he will be able to do any offline project work

Tshego said he has a pc but does not run android studio

 Siya and Walter said their PCs where ok

And I have and unreliable PC but it can work
2020/04/21, 17:17 - +27 62 244 7280: I guess with this we are set to continue with the project
2020/04/21, 17:18 - +27 62 244 7280: Before I send an email to Rylan regarding our situation is there anything any of you would like add?
2020/04/29, 20:49 - +27 62 244 7280: Awe Gents what are your thoughts on how we should continue the the project, I would like that we do a Sprint Meeting to re evaluate the future of each member
2020/04/29, 21:16 - +27 78 671 1985: IMG-20200429-WA0014.jpg (file attached)
Ayt kwl... But we should probably finish Bongisiphos part first (profile page) so we can present something on Monday
2020/04/29, 21:18 - JiGsAw: Yeah , on Saturday  we should really  look in that,  and check if everything  is running well before Monday.
2020/04/29, 21:23 - +27 78 671 1985: Totally agree...

Sat we should finish Bongisiphos part and put everything together to see if it's working...

Sunday we could play around with this Google meet thingy and just make sure Monday will go as planned
2020/04/29, 21:25 - JiGsAw: I couldn't  have said it better myself  💯💯💯💯👊🏿👊🏿👊🏿

2020/05/02, 14:16 - JiGsAw: It doesn't  allow  me , and it says I'm not on list  of sudos
2020/05/02, 14:17 - JiGsAw: And I again I just presumed  that perhaps they installed it for us 
I tried mysql -u cdlamini -p;

2020/05/03, 12:17 - +27 78 671 1985: Yho Walter or Chester may you please run the app and check that it can login successful... 

From the java side you'll have to chance a bit because the server is returning true or false now

2020/05/11, 19:35 - JiGsAw: How do we fix it ???
2020/05/11, 19:36 - +27 62 244 7280: I just need to select the information that we need and delete the one that we don't
2020/05/11, 19:37 - +27 62 244 7280: It seems like it's a merge between Siya's work and mine, I will probably delete most of my code since Siya's one worked more
2020/05/11, 19:38 - JiGsAw: Okay cool  , if you need to delete  all the php files is coool I'll upload  them again from the sever to git
2020/05/11, 19:39 - +27 62 244 7280: Nah it's cool
I think It's just the android files
2020/05/11, 19:40 - JiGsAw: Cool
2020/05/12, 06:11 - +27 78 671 1985: Did you manage to fix it? The PHP file Davies wrote only returns true or false, so the json object you create there are not needed anymore
2020/05/12, 06:26 - +27 78 671 1985: The only thing I changed, I think it was from (user something...) Class was the if conditions to login and register
2020/05/12, 06:26 - +27 62 244 7280: Yebo
2020/05/12, 06:27 - +27 62 244 7280: Logging in as 1234 four works but not new registrations
2020/05/12, 06:29 - +27 62 244 7280: Did you encrypt the data when registering or logging in, cause I believe login.php compares the given password from the app with the hashed one
2020/05/12, 06:29 - +27 78 671 1985: They worked before though
2020/05/12, 06:29 - +27 78 671 1985: Nope
2020/05/12, 06:30 - +27 62 244 7280: Ok, I found the problem
2020/05/12, 06:30 - +27 62 244 7280: 🤦‍♂️😅am hashing twice
2020/05/12, 06:31 - +27 78 671 1985: 👍🏽ayt kwl
2020/05/12, 06:34 - +27 62 244 7280: I checked out your first market Unit test file
2020/05/12, 06:34 - +27 62 244 7280: It really helped
2020/05/12, 06:40 - +27 78 671 1985: Kwl man, the testing you really just asserting your desired outcome with what the app returns
2020/05/12, 06:43 - +27 62 244 7280: https://developer.android.com/studio/test
As well as this website
I could not find a way to link cycleci yet but it should be that you edit the config.yml and insert code that will run the goods for you, like gradle
2020/05/12, 06:47 - +27 78 671 1985: Will check it out...
2020/05/12, 06:47 - +27 62 244 7280: Yoshi
2020/05/12, 07:21 - JiGsAw: Lol you weren't supposed to do any hashing at all from android side, I have written them on the php files
2020/05/12, 07:22 - +27 62 244 7280: 😂there was an encryption function on the android side so I thought it was a cool mix up
2020/05/12, 07:24 - JiGsAw: 😂lol alright
2020/05/12, 07:26 - +27 62 244 7280: Yo can you transfer some of the tables that are in the pdf into mysql
2020/05/12, 07:28 - JiGsAw: You mean like creating them on the server ???
2020/05/12, 07:28 - +27 62 244 7280: Yes
2020/05/12, 07:30 - JiGsAw: @27662515712  ,can you attend that matter ?
2020/05/12, 07:30 - +27 66 251 5712: Yeah
2020/05/12, 07:32 - +27 62 244 7280: Yoshi
2020/05/12, 07:33 - JiGsAw: Password for mysql : ICTPass1670
2020/05/12, 07:34 - JiGsAw: Use that server, I just sent the credentials
2020/05/12, 07:58 - +27 66 251 5712: Done
2020/05/23, 19:34 - +27 78 671 1985: Did any of y'all figure out the circleci situation?...

Because all I got is that we must change our config.yml but I don't know exactly what to change
2020/05/23, 20:55 - +27 78 671 1985: https://circleci.com/docs/2.0/language-android/

2020/05/23, 20:59 - JiGsAw: When is our next sprint 😭
2020/05/23, 20:59 - JiGsAw: Not this Monday please
2020/05/23, 20:59 - +27 78 671 1985: Monday dawg
2020/05/23, 20:59 - +27 78 671 1985: This one
2020/05/23, 21:00 - JiGsAw: 😂😂 I'm not laughing 💔💔


what php files do u need
2020/05/23, 21:02 - JiGsAw: Have you written a function to post pictures in android
2020/05/23, 21:02 - +27 78 671 1985: Yep just need to update to take in a pic as well
2020/05/23, 21:03 - +27 78 671 1985: Wrote a fiction to take in the particulars to add an item
2020/05/23, 21:05 - JiGsAw: Bafethu, Tomorrow we need all hands on deck . 😥
2020/05/23, 21:05 - +27 78 671 1985: Also need a PHP to take in rating and from one person and add it to the rest then average it
2020/05/23, 21:05 - JiGsAw: We need to polish up everything
2020/05/23, 21:06 - JiGsAw: Cool. And I will check taiga  and make sure I add all the necessary files
2020/05/23, 21:07 - +27 78 671 1985: Need PHP for buy function... Basically need to update funds available and items remaining
2020/05/23, 21:09 - JiGsAw: I will do that by 10 am tomorrow
2020/05/23, 21:09 - +27 78 671 1985: And a way to return all the rating so we can sort the items in the market place
2020/05/23, 21:10 - +27 78 671 1985: Awe boi
2020/05/23, 21:14 - JiGsAw: Okay  cool
2020/05/23, 21:33 - +27 61 676 3118: For  Java/android code we use Chester's branch right?
2020/05/23, 21:35 - +27 62 244 7280: No the master
2020/05/23, 21:36 - +27 62 244 7280: Wait unless you are afraid you will break the code, cause am not sure if it's still a good idea use that one since it differs from master
2020/05/23, 21:37 - +27 62 244 7280: Consider creating a new branch for the java, maybe
2020/05/23, 21:48 - +27 61 676 3118: Where does Siya upload his work? I can do it there.
2020/05/23, 21:54 - +27 78 671 1985: I uploaded on masters... There is a new function under resources function
2020/05/23, 21:55 - +27 78 671 1985: If you can improve it please do🙏🏼
2020/05/23, 21:57 - +27 78 671 1985: Under resources kudu kard app
2020/05/23, 22:01 - JiGsAw: Siya, use productAmount as your variable name for the amount of the product the user will be buying and I will check if the user has enough money to buy, 

I will return false if they dont have enough amount  
Or I will return  the new balance  they have on their card if it was successful then you will update it on the app
2020/05/23, 22:06 - +27 61 676 3118: Okay, cool.
2020/05/23, 22:06 - +27 78 671 1985: Ayt but in the function I wrote I already checked that... Before I send the request to update amount and items we first check that? 

Is it easier to do that on the android side or server?
2020/05/23, 22:07 - +27 61 676 3118: Marketplacehelper?
2020/05/23, 22:07 - +27 78 671 1985: Yep
2020/05/23, 22:07 - +27 61 676 3118: Okay.
2020/05/23, 22:07 - JiGsAw: In that case, I will just update the amount  ✔️✔️
2020/05/23, 22:20 - JiGsAw: I named the file buy.php
2020/05/23, 22:25 - +27 78 671 1985: I saw a branch on our git called PHP files, why don't you push those PHP files there, will read them from there and any changes required we'll ask you
2020/05/23, 22:27 - JiGsAw: 😂😂😂 i will push them now 

I just thought it will be a drag for u to go there to just check that.
2020/05/23, 22:32 - +27 78 671 1985: Ungafi Boi I know exactly what to check to connect php and Android side code🤣
2020/05/23, 22:33 - JiGsAw: 😂😂😂😂
2020/05/24, 12:39 - +27 62 244 7280: Yo, I think we might have to make the whole repository the android project and remove other stuff that is  not needed
2020/05/24, 12:42 - +27 78 671 1985: Put everything else in another branch
2020/05/24, 12:43 - +27 62 244 7280: Yeap accept the circle Ci and readme
2020/05/24, 12:53 - JiGsAw: Jitas for rating an item, I was thinking we could have a rating table that stores item id,  student number , and rate 

Whenever an item is added to its respective category we add its Id  on the rating table
2020/05/24, 12:54 - JiGsAw: I dont know if any of you have another solution
2020/05/24, 12:58 - +27 62 244 7280: do we need the student number?
2020/05/24, 12:59 - +27 78 671 1985: That's what I was thinking we don't need student number
2020/05/24, 12:59 - +27 62 244 7280: or is that so that the person does not rate the item again?
2020/05/24, 12:59 - +27 78 671 1985: Just the item id and the rating
2020/05/24, 12:59 - JiGsAw: We don't want a user to rate one item more than once, so will keep track by the student  number
2020/05/24, 13:01 - +27 78 671 1985: Won't that be a bit complicated when you trying to combine ratings of the same item from different users
2020/05/24, 13:03 - JiGsAw: Not at all, we will use select where item Id  equals query and take average of that 

And having the rating table will help us avoid null values, since we only  add an item on rating table if is rated.
2020/05/24, 13:04 - +27 66 251 5712: I can do that in sql to simplify things
2020/05/24, 13:05 - +27 78 671 1985: Ayt kwl👍🏽
2020/05/24, 13:06 - JiGsAw: You will create the rating table ? Or what ?
2020/05/24, 13:07 - +27 66 251 5712: The rating table and calculate the average rating
2020/05/24, 13:09 - JiGsAw: How would u store the average??
Are you going to write a function that update that column every time a new user rate the item
2020/05/24, 13:10 - +27 62 244 7280: *Awe Gents, please don't push or pull from the repository for the next hour or so, i would to update it for circleci to work*
2020/05/24, 13:10 - JiGsAw: Awe ✔️
2020/05/24, 13:13 - +27 66 251 5712: You can just write the sql statement for calculating the average rating in the php file then
2020/05/24, 13:50 - +27 62 244 7280: IMG-20200524-WA0004.jpg (file attached)

2020/05/24, 14:43 - JiGsAw: Were doing the coveralls badges  or the tests 😂😂I'm just celebrating here and dont know what you just did .
2020/05/24, 14:45 - +27 62 244 7280: the tests from circleci, i will check out coveralls, but i think those are ok
2020/05/24, 14:45 - JiGsAw: Ohh cool 😂💯💯
2020/05/24, 14:51 - JiGsAw: IMG-20200524-WA0007.jpg (file attached)
Wats the meaning of this ???
2020/05/24, 14:52 - +27 62 244 7280: what do you want to do, merge?
2020/05/24, 14:53 - JiGsAw: Nope  I was checking  the branch, I wanted to add new files.  So I just thought  it will be great to check if everything was okay before i do so
2020/05/24, 14:54 - +27 62 244 7280: which branch is that?
2020/05/24, 14:55 - JiGsAw: php_ files
2020/05/24, 14:59 - +27 62 244 7280: ok should be alright as long as you do not merge to master
2020/05/24, 14:59 - +27 62 244 7280: since that branch has the old file structure
2020/05/24, 15:01 - JiGsAw: Ohkay cool. Will there be a time where I will have to merge it with the master ???
2020/05/24, 15:02 - +27 62 244 7280: i think you might need to delete the files that are not connected to the php files like those folders with our names on them
2020/05/24, 15:04 - JiGsAw: Everything in that branch  except  the php files ??
2020/05/24, 15:05 - JiGsAw: Even the .cirlceci  folder ??
2020/05/24, 15:08 - +27 78 671 1985: I think since we trying to build the master branch only, all the other branches will fail since the structure is not like the master one...
2020/05/24, 15:09 - +27 62 244 7280: Yes
2020/05/24, 15:09 - +27 78 671 1985: Delete it and see what happens
2020/05/24, 15:22 - JiGsAw: Yerr deleting the files 🥱what a drag 😂😂😂
2020/05/24, 15:24 - +27 62 244 7280: 😂just right click and press delete  (or was it left click?)
2020/05/24, 15:25 - JiGsAw: Yohhh, i cant delete a folder 

I have to delete the files one by one 😂😂😂😂
2020/05/24, 15:26 - +27 62 244 7280: 😂😂I can help
2020/05/24, 15:27 - JiGsAw: 😂😥😂it's fine I'm done
2020/05/24, 15:28 - +27 62 244 7280: Yoshi
2020/05/24, 15:34 - JiGsAw: IMG-20200524-WA0009.jpg (file attached)
After deleting
2020/05/24, 15:47 - +27 78 671 1985: Can you add your files though?
2020/05/24, 15:49 - JiGsAw: I think, let me check if I can
2020/05/24, 16:54 - +27 78 671 1985: Davis don't merge your branch with masters
2020/05/24, 16:54 - JiGsAw: I have deleted the old files
2020/05/24, 16:55 - JiGsAw: IMG-20200524-WA0015.jpg (file attached)
I needed  to fix this
2020/05/24, 17:03 - +27 78 671 1985: It's that circleci file you deleted
2020/05/24, 17:04 - JiGsAw: Yeha, but I added the file again.
2020/05/24, 17:05 - +27 62 244 7280: Yeah it's alright now
2020/05/24, 18:06 - +27 62 244 7280: awe @27786711985 and @27616763118 am in due process of creating the ui for the marketplace(Grid style) is there anything i should be aware of besides the stuff in taiga?
2020/05/24, 21:01 - +27 61 676 3118: Gents ,
How do the phps and for getting the  items and  the stores look like?
2020/05/24, 21:02 - +27 61 676 3118: Also will the one for user credit only return that or all the user's information.
2020/05/24, 21:58 - JiGsAw: I was just returning an array  of array 

Each array holds the items from the  same category 

Like [clothes, food,events,  stationary]
2020/05/24, 22:03 - JiGsAw: I dont think I get you on this one
Do you mean when you are buying something or just when you are on the profile page .
2020/05/24, 22:13 - +27 61 676 3118: Cool.
2020/05/24, 22:15 - +27 61 676 3118: In profile page when page in the credit text view. And when buying so we can check if the user has sufficient funds.
2020/05/24, 22:19 - +27 78 671 1985: Davies can you like return the credit amount for that specific person whenever then login, like return true and the credit amount?
2020/05/24, 22:24 - JiGsAw: You saying when you login  you also want the info for that specific person with their credit ????
2020/05/24, 22:24 - +27 78 671 1985: Ya there credit
2020/05/24, 22:25 - +27 78 671 1985: So that it can display as soon as he/she logs in on the profile page
2020/05/24, 22:26 - JiGsAw: Yeha I get that , let me check it now
2020/05/24, 22:41 - JiGsAw: I changed  the login.php  file it should  return the user's information and their credit
2020/05/24, 22:51 - +27 61 676 3118: Cool.
2020/05/24, 23:06 - +27 62 244 7280: This message was deleted
2020/05/24, 23:06 - JiGsAw: Yo, I was about to open the thing😂
2020/05/24, 23:08 - +27 62 244 7280: 😂😂😂You like things:

https://stackoverflow.com/questions/4797534/how-to-manually-send-http-post-requests-from-firefox-or-chrome-browser
2020/05/24, 23:09 - +27 62 244 7280: 🤣🤣🤣You were too slow
2020/05/24, 23:10 - JiGsAw: 😂😂lol yeah I guess,
2020/05/24, 23:55 - +27 78 671 1985: Does it still return false if it fails
2020/05/24, 23:55 - JiGsAw: Yeha
2020/05/25, 00:10 - +27 61 676 3118: Are _you_ working on it Siya?
2020/05/25, 00:11 - +27 78 671 1985: I'm writing a login unit test
2020/05/25, 00:15 - +27 61 676 3118: Cool. Where do we put the unit tests after we make them.
2020/05/25, 00:18 - +27 78 671 1985: In the app under java -> com.example.kuducredittracker (test)
2020/05/25, 00:19 - +27 61 676 3118: 👍
2020/05/25, 00:20 - JiGsAw: Were you able to get the data ??
2020/05/25, 00:21 - +27 61 676 3118: Yes. On Saturday.
2020/05/25, 00:22 - JiGsAw: Ohh cool

Lol 😂😂😂but I meant from the login file
2020/05/25, 00:24 - +27 61 676 3118: 😂 Oh.
I'm still typing to get the login working. I just saw now that it doesn't return true anymore.
2020/05/25, 00:25 - JiGsAw: But it returns some data ??
2020/05/25, 00:26 - +27 61 676 3118: Only when login.php returns false
2020/05/25, 00:36 - +27 62 244 7280: Otherwise it returns null
2020/05/25, 00:37 - +27 62 244 7280: curl -i -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded" -d "studentNumber=1234&password=1234" https://lamp.ms.wits.ac.za/~s1965919/login.php
2020/05/25, 00:37 - +27 62 244 7280: This is way to do it on terminal or cmd
2020/05/25, 00:39 - +27 61 676 3118: Cool!
2020/05/25, 00:40 - JiGsAw: The null value comes from the fact that the credit table has no records
2020/05/25, 00:43 - +27 61 676 3118: We could set the value each time a user registers
2020/05/25, 00:44 - JiGsAw: Yeha that's  a cool idea
2020/05/25, 01:11 - +27 78 671 1985: Ehh Chester I can't write a test because  UserAccount class requires me to parse in String[] and context, do you have  a way around this...
I also can't take the input from the edit text because the test class does not extend AppcompactActivity  ...

Am trying to access the login function in order to test it
2020/05/25, 01:13 - +27 62 244 7280: What are you testing?
2020/05/25, 01:16 - +27 62 244 7280: Is it the constructor?
2020/05/25, 01:17 - +27 78 671 1985: Yep
2020/05/25, 01:19 - +27 78 671 1985: Testing login because I know this guy is gonna ask us again for a login unit test... Or some other unit test, but since there is a Test for market we'll be fine with the market one
2020/05/25, 01:23 - +27 62 244 7280: Save your test file inside your androidTest directory. In there you will use the AndroidJUnits4 test class with this you can create get kuducardtracker context and you can manually set the string array
2020/05/25, 01:24 - +27 62 244 7280: With in the androidTest directory there is a sample file which might help you get a better feel towards what am trying to say😅
2020/05/25, 01:26 - +27 78 671 1985: Bro I'm writing a test in the test file you created for email, I'm filling in the ones you haven't yet...
2020/05/25, 01:27 - +27 78 671 1985: Since that function login was returning a Boolean if I could assess it I would just assertTrue and I'm done, can do the same for register
2020/05/25, 01:27 - +27 62 244 7280: Create another test file or import the packages. Within :
2020/05/25, 01:28 - +27 62 244 7280: ExampleInstrumentedTest
2020/05/25, 01:29 - +27 62 244 7280: from androidTest
2020/05/25, 01:30 - +27 78 671 1985: Ayt I'll see it first thing tomz😴
2020/05/25, 01:31 - +27 62 244 7280: Ok what have you done so far?
2020/05/25, 01:35 - +27 78 671 1985: I wrote the test I was just trying to get around the constructor thingy... I think for tomz Ima just have the test for 1234 any other login will fail
2020/05/25, 01:35 - +27 62 244 7280: Ok yoshi
2020/05/25, 11:06 - +27 62 244 7280: Awe gents
2020/05/25, 11:07 - +27 62 244 7280: are we all alive?
2020/05/25, 11:20 - JiGsAw: Yeah,  I am
2020/05/25, 11:20 - +27 62 244 7280: We need dumpy variables on the mysql
2020/05/25, 11:21 - JiGsAw: Some values in the tables ???
2020/05/25, 11:22 - +27 62 244 7280: Yeap
2020/05/25, 11:23 - JiGsAw: The tables are some many man, which ones exactly
2020/05/25, 11:23 - +27 62 244 7280: The stores and items
2020/05/25, 11:42 - JiGsAw: Done
2020/05/25, 11:44 - +27 62 244 7280: Yoshi
2020/05/25, 11:44 - JiGsAw: IMG-20200525-WA0001.jpg (file attached)
This is the output from the getItem.php
2020/05/25, 11:48 - +27 62 244 7280: where are the ratings?
2020/05/25, 11:48 - JiGsAw: Rate them on the app
2020/05/25, 11:49 - JiGsAw: You mean , I should also select their ratings from the table
2020/05/25, 11:52 - +27 62 244 7280: yeap, but i see you have another php file for that
2020/05/25, 11:53 - JiGsAw: I thought you'd be able to see the rating of an item, after you click the item for full description.  Then you call getRatings for that particular items
2020/05/25, 11:54 - JiGsAw: And you also can rate, when you are in a full description of an item
2020/05/25, 12:14 - +27 61 676 3118: Gents,
We have 4 diagrams out of the 7 on the repo;can someone make Atleast 2 more.
2020/05/25, 12:16 - +27 78 671 1985: I'm making one as we speak
2020/05/25, 12:17 - +27 61 676 3118: Which one? There is a class, component, use case and erd.
2020/05/25, 12:18 - +27 78 671 1985: I'm actually making the architecture diagram
2020/05/25, 12:18 - +27 61 676 3118: Okay, cool!
2020/05/25, 12:53 - +27 62 244 7280: yo do mind returning the category
2020/05/25, 12:56 - +27 61 676 3118: This message was deleted
2020/05/25, 12:58 - +27 62 244 7280: No on the php, it does not return the category except the category's id which does not help with identifying it's category type
2020/05/25, 12:58 - +27 78 671 1985: What other diagrams do we need?
2020/05/25, 13:00 - +27 61 676 3118: Sequence and/or activity
2020/05/25, 13:02 - JiGsAw: Can't u tell from the clothes_id that it comes from clothes category
2020/05/25, 13:43 - JiGsAw: Sure you can add item
2020/05/25, 13:44 - JiGsAw: @27622447280
2020/05/25, 13:46 - +27 62 244 7280: Yeap, there's already a function here to do that
2020/05/25, 13:46 - JiGsAw: I meant I added the file on the server
2020/05/25, 13:46 - +27 62 244 7280: Yoshi
2020/05/25, 13:47 - +27 78 671 1985: I couldn't get around the unit test problem we had yesterday, the test kept failing... Hopefully he won't ask about a login unit test
2020/05/25, 13:47 - +27 78 671 1985: Is taiga up to date?
2020/05/25, 13:56 - +27 61 676 3118: I changed the view to the initial list view but only 2 user stories are closed. (which we might or might not have depending on what Chester has done in the Last hour )
2020/05/25, 13:57 - +27 62 244 7280: I am currently working on adding items from the server to the gridview
2020/05/25, 13:58 - +27 61 676 3118: 👍2 minutes. No pressure! 😂
2020/05/25, 13:59 - JiGsAw: 😂😂
2020/05/25, 13:59 - +27 78 671 1985: But can you transition from profile page to market place, the functionality won't be that important as long as  he sees the front-end
2020/05/25, 14:01 - +27 78 671 1985: Take what we have, let's go🏃🏽‍♂️
2020/05/25, 14:03 - +27 62 244 7280: 😂if I kak I will just revert back to the original

Sprint Retrospective Marks.pdf
2020/05/28, 12:47 - JiGsAw: Jitas, we need to polish up our things and go to 75+ average 😭
2020/05/28, 12:47 - JiGsAw: Is just us with low Mark's
2020/05/28, 12:52 - +27 78 671 1985: We below average dawg🤦🏽‍♂️
2020/05/28, 12:53 - +27 78 671 1985: We must stop with this last minute thing
2020/05/28, 12:53 - JiGsAw: Bruh, on Saturday I want to see a work app😂😂😂😂. I will do it on my side also
2020/05/28, 12:53 - JiGsAw: Working
2020/05/28, 16:17 - JiGsAw: @27622447280 can you please set up a meeting with him , tomorrow or Monday
2020/05/28, 16:27 - +27 78 671 1985: I think Chester set a date for Tuesday... we'll try to get the app up to date (weekend) before we have the meeting
2020/05/28, 16:28 - JiGsAw: That will be cool.
2020/05/28, 16:29 - +27 78 671 1985: Final presentation on the 8th... Will it be online still???
2020/05/28, 16:30 - JiGsAw: I think so. I am not sure 
We can ask rylan  on Tuesday
2020/05/28, 16:31 - +27 78 671 1985: Do you know when CGV final presentation is?
2020/05/28, 16:37 - JiGsAw: 5 june 😂😂😂
2020/05/28, 16:38 - JiGsAw: Yohh sh*t is getting real
2020/05/28, 16:40 - JiGsAw: Next week Thursday 😂😂😂
2020/05/28, 16:40 - +27 78 671 1985: 🥵🥵🥵🤦🏽‍♂️ we need a strategy gents to get everything done... Do you thing splitting the team one focus on game the other on SD???
2020/05/28, 16:41 - +27 78 671 1985: But we need to start like ASAP
2020/05/28, 16:49 - JiGsAw: I had an idea of how to merge the game into one , and add the skybox. So  I will do it over the night and I will change the tree  obstacles since they mess up with the collision . 



I will upload the whole thing by tomorrow  on my lamp  if everyone is satisfied will upload on git and will just add some other things on it 



With merging  the game into one , 

Will have long running environment 


Say 10k long 

Level 1 will take up to 3k long
Level 2 will take up to 7k long from 3k  and level 3 take from 7k to 10k

0 - 3k  we add level  1 obstacles 
3k - 7k level 2 obstacles 
7k- 10k level 3 obstacles 
Then it will create  an illusion of three levels 


I don't know if is fine but that is what I thought atleast 

And it will be easy to win from one level  to the other
2020/05/28, 16:53 - +27 61 676 3118: How would you do the level 2 physics then?
2020/05/28, 16:54 - +27 78 671 1985: Do we still need the interface, I heard Chester talking about an UI before we play the game?
2020/05/28, 16:55 - JiGsAw: I will try to use your  obstacles but will be avoiding them by going to left or right , 

Perhaps the physics didn't  work because u used boxes to approximate cylinders.
2020/05/28, 16:56 - JiGsAw: I'm not sure, we can still add it
2020/05/28, 17:02 - +27 61 676 3118: How about instead of using a canvas that's the whole screen wide we make it 3/4 the width of the screen and the remaining 1/4 is for buttons that go to each level. But the button for lvl2 and 3 only become visible/enabled once you have played passed the previous. That way we can keep lvl2 and just have to worry about its physics.
2020/05/28, 17:02 - +27 61 676 3118: Is that where you want to add a sky ox?
2020/05/28, 17:03 - +27 61 676 3118: Skybox?
2020/05/28, 17:06 - JiGsAw: How  is the rendering  taking place ?
Do you clear what is being render before and render the new scene or what 

I just want to get the part on how you'd render the three different  scenes
2020/05/28, 17:08 - JiGsAw: I just didn't  have a clear vision  on where to add it. But it can work  there .
2020/05/28, 17:09 - +27 61 676 3118: Swap out the html pages.
2020/05/28, 17:10 - +27 61 676 3118: Cool.
2020/05/28, 17:10 - JiGsAw: Cool sound perfect 💯💯

I tried the clear and render method, 💔😭
2020/05/28, 17:11 - +27 61 676 3118: 😂 It's a pain.
2020/05/28, 17:12 - JiGsAw: Bruh😂😂😂
2020/05/28, 17:12 - +27 61 676 3118: How are we going to split?
2020/05/28, 17:13 - +27 78 671 1985: If we splitting since Davis and you look like you've got the game part down, y'all can work on that and me and Chester we'll tackle the SD...
2020/05/28, 17:13 - JiGsAw: How about we do the game tonight till in the morning. The whole of it 😂

I mean there isn't  much left of it 😂
2020/05/28, 17:14 - JiGsAw: We done over the weekend  we go back to sd
2020/05/28, 17:15 - +27 78 671 1985: But weekend me and Chester we'll be trying to get the project working for Tuesday... I'll also try and fix the image thingy
2020/05/28, 17:16 - +27 78 671 1985: The game don't we still need a camera change... And a way to use the mouse
2020/05/28, 17:16 - JiGsAw: We can use the mouse where there is a skybox
2020/05/28, 17:17 - +27 61 676 3118: We have a camera(restricted ) change that let's you change the angle of view in the tunnel
2020/05/28, 17:17 - JiGsAw: When you click from left to right it runs in that direction
2020/05/28, 17:18 - JiGsAw: If nothing the mouse is  not click  random  movements
2020/05/28, 17:18 - +27 78 671 1985: 👍🏽
2020/05/28, 17:20 - +27 61 676 3118: Thats a good idea.
2020/05/28, 17:21 - +27 78 671 1985: Ayt kwl... 

On SD side it's the app the coveralls unit tests, taiga with acceptance criteria??? That's about it ryt?
2020/05/28, 17:21 - +27 78 671 1985: And we'll see what Ryan wants Tuesday
2020/05/28, 17:22 - +27 61 676 3118: Yes.
2020/05/28, 17:23 - +27 61 676 3118: So Davis you work on the Skybox and it's mouse use and I will do lvl switching and lv2 physics(hopefully) ?
2020/05/28, 17:24 - JiGsAw: Sounds okay , 💯💯💯
2020/05/28, 17:24 - +27 61 676 3118: Cool. 👍
2020/05/28, 17:25 - JiGsAw: Chester do you have the new models, 
I will need one that looks around just for the random moves
2020/05/28, 17:30 - +27 78 671 1985: Kwl Monday we'll update each other and if y'all need more hands on deck will try and finish The game, and Wednesday we'll polish up on it, add some fun thing if time allows it
2020/05/28, 17:31 - JiGsAw: 💯✔️✔️
2020/05/28, 23:06 - +27 62 244 7280: Sorry for the late respond, the model in the folder called zucky has animations I was playing around with, but if you have specific ones you would like to add inform me and I will do so
2020/05/28, 23:07 - +27 62 244 7280: I was also still have some trouble with retaining the texture of the model after adding the moves but I should be able to add textures onto it
2020/05/28, 23:11 - +27 62 244 7280: On the circleci coveralls bit here's what I know so far:

-build.gradle is responsible for the testing of the java files

- the build.gradle should have a function(coveralls) which retrieves data from the tests on circleci and sends it to the coveralls website
2020/05/28, 23:14 - +27 78 671 1985: 👍🏽
2020/05/28, 23:14 - JiGsAw: Okay sure, I probably start by midnight since I'll be having enough data to surf the web

2020/06/01, 15:46 - +27 62 244 7280: Also noticed that the STUDENTS table might be the new user table

2020/07/28, 13:29 - +27 61 676 3118: Too bad we lost our star web developer.
2020/07/28, 13:30 - JiGsAw: 🤣🤣🤣🚶‍♂️🚶‍♂️🚶‍♂️
2020/07/28, 13:30 - JiGsAw: Tshego and I can do the front end
2020/07/28, 13:32 - +27 62 244 7280: I believe the you can still use the already existing php files to set it up as well
2020/07/28, 13:34 - JiGsAw: Olay cool
2020/07/28, 13:46 - +27 62 244 7280: Awe gents, instead of us having subteams that focus on the back end and the front end individually, why not have subteams that focus on one full feature each
2020/07/28, 13:50 - +27 62 244 7280: This way we won't have to wait on others in other to complete one specific section of the project

So for example if one subteam is working on the login and register then they are responsible for all the other things that concern that part, the database, the functions and the diagrams link to that as well
2020/07/28, 13:52 - +27 61 676 3118: So we could split in one group of 2 and another of 3 then split the user stories the same way?
2020/07/28, 13:53 - JiGsAw: I think this could work
2020/07/28, 13:56 - +27 62 244 7280: Yoshi now it's a matter of splitting the user stories

We also had some o  the app side which were

The user should be able to add a profile picture when register (Maybe also after they have logged in As well)
2020/07/28, 13:57 - JiGsAw: How about you do the splitting  of the user stories and assign them to us🤓
2020/07/28, 13:59 - +27 62 244 7280: 😂ok, Walt I might your help
2020/07/28, 14:01 - JiGsAw: 🤣⚰️
2020/07/28, 14:01 - +27 61 676 3118: We could go {login, register, profile} and {web market place, history}
2020/07/28, 14:05 - +27 62 244 7280: There are six of them so Davis and Tshego go with {Login, Register, Profile}

Then me, Siya and Walt will go for {Web Marketplace, History, {App Register Profile Picture}}
2020/07/28, 14:06 - +27 61 676 3118: 👍
2020/07/28, 14:08 - JiGsAw: Cool
2020/07/28, 16:33 - +27 62 244 7280: We will also need a new repo for the website
2020/08/04, 22:57 - +27 62 244 7280: Awe agents, I think we should have a separate repo for the website as well
2020/08/04, 23:01 - +27 62 244 7280: Advantages would be:
- Direct access to the repo on the lamp server, so you can push/pull from the server
- Can easily differentiate between the website's tasks and the app's tasks

Disadvantages:
- Redoing the test-coverage setting for html, JavaScript and php on the new repo
2020/08/04, 23:35 - JiGsAw: It's a good idea.

 we needed to change the php files anyway. a little actually. 
So it would not matter that much 
And as for test-coverage , it's no like we did much last semester
2020/08/05, 00:53 - +27 62 244 7280: Ok fresh I will set it up
2020/08/07, 19:04 - +27 61 676 3118: Awe Davis and Tshego, when implementing the login page can you please set the cookies of the  history_page  to the session's username.
2020/08/07, 20:02 - JiGsAw: I will upload the files I have on github tomorrow, I  dont have my pc with me right now.


And  I think I have already done some similar to that
2020/08/07, 20:59 - +27 61 676 3118: Okay, cool.
2020/08/09, 11:06 - JiGsAw: They have published the Marks for Software design
2020/08/10, 11:04 - +27 62 244 7280: Awe gents
2020/08/10, 11:05 - +27 62 244 7280: Here's this week's update
2020/08/10, 11:09 - +27 62 244 7280: 1.) A repo has been has been created on Github : https://github.com/The-Combrades/Kudu-Card-Credit-Tracker/
2.) There's a new column in the STUDENTS table(called PP_URL) for the profile picture. unfortunately this means that there will arise new problems in the register or login but the fix is simple just include PP_URL value when registering or any other query that requires inserting into the STUDENTS table
3.)
2020/08/10, 11:11 - +27 62 244 7280: RE:

1.) The repo is also available on the server and it stands alone i.e the website has it own files and so does the app
3.)
2020/08/10, 11:12 - +27 62 244 7280: 3.) We have a sprint retro meeting with one of the tutors tomorrow at 2:45pm-3:30
4.) We also have a sprint meeting with Rylan on friday at 1:00-1:30
2020/08/10, 11:13 - +27 62 244 7280: Please include anything i forgot to go over
2020/08/10, 11:33 - +27 61 676 3118: Okay and Thank you.
2020/08/10, 21:49 - JiGsAw: If any of you get error when accessing the file index.html on the server is because I renamed it to index.php
2020/08/10, 21:50 - JiGsAw: IMG-20200810-WA0035.jpg (file attached)
This is how it should  look.
2020/08/10, 21:52 - JiGsAw: You can combine  other stuffs to that file.

2020/08/11, 15:18 - +27 78 671 1985: Atleast this one has emotions unlike the one from last semester🤣
2020/08/11, 15:19 - JiGsAw: He even wanted coveralls

2020/08/11, 15:20 - +27 78 671 1985: That's good ryt👍🏽
2020/08/11, 15:20 - JiGsAw: I suppose 🤣
2020/08/11, 15:21 - JiGsAw: But it was a hell of torture, since I didn't prepare anything
2020/08/11, 15:21 - JiGsAw: I had to open the tabs will presenting. I was just all over the internet 🤣🤣
2020/08/11, 15:21 - JiGsAw: Next time try to join 10 mins before the meeting 🤣🤣

2020/08/13, 08:14 - +27 62 244 7280's security code changed. Tap for more info.
2020/08/14, 12:47 - +27 62 244 7280: Awe gents I might be late to the meeting
2020/08/14, 12:57 - +27 61 676 3118: I'm trying to enter I can't. Same problem as last time.
2020/08/14, 12:58 - +27 62 244 7280: Never this, I made it
2020/08/14, 12:59 - +27 62 244 7280: https://meet.google.com/jew-zobe-bwk
2020/08/14, 13:00 - +27 61 676 3118: Did you receive my request to join with another account?
2020/08/14, 13:02 - +27 61 676 3118: Okay I got it.
2020/08/14, 13:02 - +27 61 676 3118: He said well start all 13:05
2020/08/14, 13:33 - +27 62 244 7280: Awe gents
2020/08/14, 13:33 - JiGsAw: Awe
2020/08/14, 13:35 - +27 62 244 7280: The user stories are:
 Search specific
search general
centre product image
fix login account text
put price on marketplace
And reviews on app
2020/08/14, 13:36 - +27 62 244 7280: Does any have any idea how we could possibly implement testing on the website?
2020/08/14, 13:36 - +27 62 244 7280: I believe we should be able to test php
2020/08/14, 13:37 - +27 62 244 7280: Not so sure able html, css and JavaScript
2020/08/14, 13:37 - JiGsAw: I dont.
I dont even have an  idea on what should be tested.
2020/08/14, 13:39 - +27 78 671 1985: Dawg😪
2020/08/14, 13:40 - +27 78 671 1985: Didn't he say something about the rating system on web
2020/08/14, 13:41 - JiGsAw: On the website we should have another page for a specific user. Where they will be able to add new stuff and have more control.
2020/08/14, 13:43 - JiGsAw: A meeting with a tutor might help
2020/08/14, 13:43 - +27 62 244 7280: Well currently out of speculation, I would say 1.) we can convert the most of the code into functions (in php and JavaScript) then do tests on those, for example a buy function which when given a user ID, password and item_ID returns a number which says what error might have occurred
2020/08/14, 13:45 - +27 62 244 7280: 2.) We use JavaScript to check the returned webpage and all the things that might be needed in it
2020/08/14, 13:47 - JiGsAw: Yes. This is what we should do.
2020/08/14, 13:50 - JiGsAw: And in the register.php
I covered some cases where the user might not be able to register, it will be a great idea to pop up that messages nicely  unlike what I did now.
2020/08/14, 13:51 - JiGsAw: You go to the website and have a look  at it
2020/08/14, 13:52 - JiGsAw: Try to create  a new account  for 1234.
You should  get an error or message.

If anyone can fix that to something  like this
2020/08/14, 13:53 - JiGsAw: IMG-20200814-WA0000.jpg (file attached)
2020/08/14, 13:53 - JiGsAw: Then you display  the correct message for why you cant register that new account.
2020/08/14, 13:55 - +27 62 244 7280: Ok yoshi
Let us set up the tasks from the user stories
2020/08/14, 13:55 - +27 78 671 1985: Ayt kwl they are 5 user stories and 5 of us how are we distributing this, I can continue on the app and finish it off
2020/08/14, 13:55 - +27 78 671 1985: And are we still updating on taiga?
2020/08/14, 13:56 - +27 62 244 7280: I believe this can be done using embedded php with JavaScript
2020/08/14, 13:56 - JiGsAw: Yes we should. That nigga wanted to see it, hopefully walter managed to took care of it.
2020/08/14, 13:57 - +27 62 244 7280: Yes, Walt has been dealing with that
2020/08/14, 13:57 - +27 62 244 7280: As well as the diagrams
2020/08/14, 13:58 - +27 62 244 7280: 😂Gents is Tshego still in the land of the living?
2020/08/14, 13:58 - JiGsAw: How the search general and search specific differ??
2020/08/14, 13:59 - +27 78 671 1985: Search specific is suppose to give you a specific item on the marketplace
2020/08/14, 13:59 - JiGsAw: Yes, but I dont think he is online now.
2020/08/14, 13:59 - JiGsAw: General,  the category??
2020/08/14, 14:00 - +27 78 671 1985: Search general is gonna give you a general search, EG laptops, will show all laptops on the marketplace
2020/08/14, 14:00 - +27 78 671 1985: Anything with the world laptop
2020/08/14, 14:01 - +27 78 671 1985: Word
2020/08/14, 14:01 - +27 78 671 1985: So if you search a, it will give you all the items with a in there name
2020/08/14, 14:02 - JiGsAw: When implementing the search . Shouldnt we implement specific search then the default will be general search.

In a way that the user doesn't necessarily have to specify between  search general and search specific
2020/08/14, 14:05 - +27 78 671 1985: Ya he said it one thing but said search general might be the hardest user story
2020/08/14, 14:06 - JiGsAw: Okay cool
2020/08/14, 14:06 - JiGsAw: How are distributing the user stories.
2020/08/14, 14:06 - JiGsAw: We
2020/08/14, 14:15 - +27 62 244 7280: I can work on the design and the other small things
2020/08/14, 14:17 - +27 78 671 1985: Okay so that login account text, centre product image and price on marketplace?
2020/08/14, 14:18 - +27 62 244 7280: Yebo
2020/08/14, 14:18 - +27 78 671 1985: Dope so what's left is the search
2020/08/14, 14:18 - +27 62 244 7280: we might also need to work on restructuring the code for testing
2020/08/14, 14:19 - +27 62 244 7280: Review system
And search
2020/08/14, 14:19 - +27 78 671 1985: Yep our biggest problem is the testing, if we get that we on a home run
2020/08/14, 14:21 - +27 78 671 1985: 👆
2020/08/14, 14:22 - +27 78 671 1985: Meaning I'll handle the review on the app
2020/08/14, 14:22 - +27 62 244 7280: Oh yes as well as the diagrams
2020/08/14, 14:23 - +27 62 244 7280: Yoshi
2020/08/14, 14:23 - +27 78 671 1985: What diagrams do we need?
2020/08/14, 14:25 - +27 62 244 7280: The structure of the site, update to the Student tables and any additions made to the app
2020/08/14, 14:29 - JiGsAw: I can work on that
2020/08/14, 14:30 - JiGsAw: The homepage?
2020/08/14, 14:32 - JiGsAw: On this one. We should  allow the user to add multiple  items on cart before checking them out.
2020/08/14, 14:33 - +27 62 244 7280: Yoshi that's a great idea
2020/08/14, 14:34 - JiGsAw: Jitas this is not a website for shopping only let's not forget that,  I can even see our supervisor has drifted away from the original idea
2020/08/14, 14:34 - JiGsAw: Try to have tabs for events
2020/08/14, 14:35 - JiGsAw: Happening at wits
2020/08/17, 12:22 - JiGsAw: Hey gents.
2020/08/17, 12:25 - +27 62 244 7280: Awe
2020/08/17, 12:59 - +27 78 671 1985: You want us to set up a meeting with a tutor?
2020/08/17, 13:04 - JiGsAw: I think that will be great .
2020/08/17, 13:04 - JiGsAw: How are we planning to tackle the test  cases
2020/08/17, 13:09 - +27 78 671 1985: Yep I think so too.. but last time we asked for help with testing that guy said it won't be fair to the others if he told us... But I think we should try
2020/08/17, 13:18 - JiGsAw: we dont really know where to start.
But we might get an understanding guy

2020/08/23, 18:17 - +27 61 676 3118: Hey Guys,
I have set up Travis-Ci for php on the Repo. The test framework is phpunit.

1) Put all your php tests in the Test folder
2) name of php file must have the prefix 'test'
3) the class must extend PHPUnit\Framework\TestCase
2020/08/24, 02:30 - JiGsAw: Jitas, I have done the search. Is still in construction. But you can search items. 
When you reload  that's  when you get to see that is not complete. 

And the index.php is bit messy, we'll probably need functions not what I did 🤣🤣🤣
2020/08/25, 09:30 - JiGsAw: IMG-20200825-WA0009.jpg (file attached)
Did any of you add that part or it was just there this whole time. But I remember removing it though. I can't access lamp server now.
2020/08/25, 09:35 - JiGsAw: This makes $ to not be defined as the jquery is not loaded hence the search is no longer working. Unless it doesn't work under vpn data. I am just confused.😃
2020/08/25, 09:39 - +27 62 244 7280: It was me, give a sec I will remove it
2020/08/25, 09:41 - JiGsAw: Is the search working on your side ??
2020/08/25, 09:41 - +27 62 244 7280: No
2020/08/25, 09:42 - +27 62 244 7280: There was a point yesterday where it was working
2020/08/25, 09:45 - JiGsAw: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/5852767/possible-to-defer-loading-of-jquery
2020/08/25, 09:45 - JiGsAw: you might want to do that if you still want to defer it
2020/08/25, 09:48 - +27 62 244 7280: Yoshi thanks I will jong it

2020/09/02, 15:15 - JiGsAw: IMG-20200902-WA0016.jpg (file attached)
Will this be how we name the files???do we need that require_once or the files we are testing get pulled automatically ??
2020/09/02, 17:23 - +27 61 676 3118: You have to import the file you want to test. And it looks for them from a copy of the repo so the directory would  be '. /php/login.php' in this case.
2020/09/02, 17:31 - JiGsAw: You deleted this message
2020/09/02, 17:32 - JiGsAw: Unless I can import the file from lamp.
I will just see😥
2020/09/02, 17:33 - JiGsAw: Then how are we gonna escape the same origin policy...
When I was testing the login 
I mocked  the class to give me a certain  values then checked them against the ones we get when we login.

When we upload the files on travis
How are they gonna executed
2020/09/02, 19:07 - +27 61 676 3118: 1)Put your tests in the Test folder on the repo.
2) test any of the files on the repo by including them from the php folder that is on the repo.
2020/09/02, 19:11 - JiGsAw: Okay. Cool.
I will let you know how it goes. 
I will upload  them at midnight
2020/09/02, 19:28 - +27 61 676 3118: Okay.
2020/09/09, 11:25 - +27 78 671 1985's security code changed. Tap for more info.
2020/09/09, 17:33 - +27 62 244 7280: Awe gents
2020/09/09, 17:34 - +27 62 244 7280: Hope y'all had a pleasant break
2020/09/09, 17:35 - +27 62 244 7280: The distribution of user stories is as follows:
2020/09/09, 17:37 - +27 62 244 7280: 1.) Davis
2.) Tshego
3.) Walt 
4.) Siya
5.) Me
2020/09/09, 18:20 - JiGsAw: Sho.
If you have access to your mysql account, can you please send me the dump of your database.

The local tables I have been using don't have values...

2020/09/09, 18:29 - JiGsAw: 🤣🤣
2020/09/09, 18:30 - JiGsAw: Thank you
2020/09/09, 18:31 - +27 62 244 7280: 😂i meant goods, you know man, finger tingz
2020/09/09, 18:32 - JiGsAw: I totally  understand😀
2020/09/09, 18:32 - +27 62 244 7280: awe😂
2020/09/12, 03:15 - +27 62 244 7280: Awe Davis
2020/09/12, 03:17 - JiGsAw: Awe
2020/09/12, 03:17 - +27 62 244 7280: I really liked the structure in which you decided to implement while testing the php code on the website, so this encouraged me to try and convert some more of the existing code to follow a class like structure
2020/09/12, 03:17 - +27 62 244 7280: I came across the Database class
2020/09/12, 03:19 - +27 62 244 7280: and was wondering if you could give a quick explanation on how it functions, i believe i have the basics down(querying and retrieving data from a stated query)
2020/09/12, 03:28 - JiGsAw: I am not really good at that but I will just try.

There is a constructor in the class
So when you create a new instance of that class, you are connecting to the database  basically.

From there you can define your own query and retrieving methods,  
If we wanted to login, you need to be able to query first , and test that method , before you test the login function itself.
2020/09/12, 03:29 - JiGsAw: I am not really  sure about your question...

Do you want the whole idea behind  testing or how the function actually  does the work ???
2020/09/12, 03:32 - +27 62 244 7280: I wanted to know about the resultSet method, i see that when you retrieve data like the password you had to specify the first index of the result array
2020/09/12, 03:33 - +27 62 244 7280: Also on the idea behind testing
2020/09/12, 03:41 - JiGsAw: The values from mysql are returned as key and value 

The key is the column name.

And The resultset on the login and register are different.
The one in login i kinda ran the same sql statement several time
In the register is more simpler,
I first query the database and store the result  in the stmt
And  return them in resultset 

Is more like set and get methods
2020/09/12, 03:49 - JiGsAw: Login:
Firstly  you need to understand that when you login there are two different scenarios.i.e fail and a pass
In case of a pass
You result method will return arry with password, and your login will match the passwords and return pass .

Inorder to check the functionality of the  login is necessary that you first check your getalltasks method if doing the correct  thing and you must know its return type. That is when you mock the class to give you fake results,  that is you make the resultset  to return some arrray as if is from a mysql database then you run the actua  function  and compare your results. 


For login you  do the same.
2020/09/12, 06:41 - +27 62 244 7280: Yoshi I get this now, I was a little confused with the array bit on login

Also couldn't you just include or require the Database.phphh file instead of rewriting it on all files it is needed in?
2020/09/12, 06:41 - +27 62 244 7280: Yoshi, now that I have had a deeper look and understanding on the login and database I get the idea of what you are saying

Let me fiddle some more with the part am editing and then if am lost again I will ask
2020/09/12, 06:41 - +27 62 244 7280: Thanks bro👊
2020/09/12, 10:29 - JiGsAw: I could do that and I realised after.
That's why I changed the Database.php to Database.phpp, so that it doesn't conflict with the others. 

I think I will change it back, so that we only use one Database.php
2020/09/12, 10:30 - JiGsAw: Ohkay cool.
2020/09/12, 10:30 - JiGsAw: 😎awe
2020/09/12, 11:17 - JiGsAw: And I also fixed the search in the index.php refreshing the page wont reset the search results, you can only reset the search by clicking  home

I couldn't do it in the homepage.php
Bcz there is no longer an option for home on the navigation bar
2020/09/12, 11:38 - +27 62 244 7280: Is there an option to search for nothing?
2020/09/12, 11:42 - +27 62 244 7280: Like if you insert an empty string in the search
2020/09/12, 11:58 - JiGsAw: Yes, if you were to search something in the market that is not there you will get a message...
2020/09/12, 11:58 - JiGsAw: Empty  string will give you everything in the market
2020/09/12, 11:59 - +27 62 244 7280: Yoshi I guess that's that then 👍
2020/09/13, 02:01 - +27 62 244 7280: http://zetcode.com/php/pdo/

Awe gents, here's a link for how the Database.php class works.
I believe Davis already explained above as well so can use this as a practical reference
2020/09/14, 21:10 - +27 62 244 7280: Awe gents, i have update the database tables. There's no link between the PURCHASES
 table and the MARKET_NEW table
2020/09/14, 21:10 - +27 62 244 7280: This message was deleted
2020/09/14, 21:11 - +27 62 244 7280: fo
2020/09/14, 21:11 - JiGsAw: Why did you update them
2020/09/14, 21:11 - +27 62 244 7280: This message was deleted
2020/09/14, 21:12 - JiGsAw: And how is the current tables affecting the current codes
2020/09/14, 21:16 - +27 62 244 7280: I updated them in order to implement the buy functionality which also deletes items from the marketplace. As the table was, with the foreign key constraint on the PURCHASES table, i was not able to delete an image from the marketplace without violating the link. So i added the missing columns from the marketplace table to the purchases table to keep record of the full item
2020/09/14, 21:18 - +27 62 244 7280: The affected code is the buying functionality code and getHistory from both the app and website and any other code which way linked to the purchases table
2020/09/14, 21:21 - JiGsAw: But I think it was unnecessary to do so bcz there is commit command in mysql, whereby you perform multiple queries at the same time.

If you wanted to delete something  you would  start from ratings,purchase then market_new table.
2020/09/14, 21:24 - JiGsAw: If lot of code is going to be affected you might consider reverting the changes since Tomorrow is a marking day.

But as long as you can get the changes to be  covered it's super cool
2020/09/14, 21:25 - +27 62 244 7280: which part of the project is the command?
2020/09/14, 21:26 - +27 62 244 7280: Yoshi, i had already fixed the buy functionality for the app
2020/09/14, 21:28 - JiGsAw: I saw the command online on some articles. 

If you  were to check the items you'd notice I delete that item that didn't have photo, by going from ratings,  purchases then market_new table
2020/09/14, 21:28 - JiGsAw: Okay cool 😎
2020/09/14, 21:29 - +27 62 244 7280: Oh yes, i will also have to remove all the data from purchase and Rating
2020/09/14, 21:34 - +27 66 251 5712: Y don't you try to add the number of items column to the table, when an item is bought, you decrement its count

Then when selecting items from the table you ignore rows which have 0 in the number of items column
2020/09/14, 21:35 - +27 62 244 7280: Oh yes i also added a quantity column with default 1 on MARKET_NEW
2020/09/14, 21:36 - JiGsAw: Exactly. 
In that way you keep track of available  goods

Coz we don't really want to change the business  rules again
2020/09/14, 21:38 - +27 62 244 7280: I had that as one of the options but i can't remember exactly why i chose the former
2020/09/14, 21:39 - +27 62 244 7280: Oh yes i was afraid to touch Davis's code😅
2020/09/14, 21:39 - +27 66 251 5712: 😂😂
2020/09/14, 21:39 - JiGsAw: 🤣🤣🤣which code ???
2020/09/14, 21:40 - +27 62 244 7280: 😂I just remembered how traumatized i was by index.html when you first created it
2020/09/14, 21:43 - JiGsAw: 🤣🤣🤣🤣well there was no way I could  populate the page with data from php without  creating  the elements  of html manual by javascript.

Well🤣🤣🤣I know you might be referring to that 🤣🤣🤣.
2020/09/14, 21:45 - +27 62 244 7280: 😂😂😂yeah that and the unseen div element
2020/09/14, 21:48 - JiGsAw: 🤣🤣🤣📌

I couldn't  think of anything  to hide the data from mysql 

I still can't  put those in their own classes 🤣
2020/09/14, 21:51 - +27 62 244 7280: 😂😂😂It was understandable, I suffered thinking of a better way, 😬Would have tried to manually do it from php
2020/09/14, 21:53 - JiGsAw: The problem  is that we lost our "web developer"
2020/09/14, 21:57 - +27 62 244 7280: 😔ah yes
2020/09/15, 10:09 - +27 62 244 7280: Awe gents I have set up a meeting with Rylan for Wednesday at 1

2020/09/18, 10:04 - +27 78 671 1985: 👍🏽
2020/09/18, 10:32 - JiGsAw: Awe
2020/09/24, 10:59 - JiGsAw: Exe jitas.
I just wanted to find out if the functions  in the helperFunctions.php are all working. The one on lamp server.

The reason I ask this is i wanted to write test  cases for that file.
2020/09/24, 11:34 - +27 62 244 7280: yebo they are
2020/09/24, 11:36 - +27 62 244 7280: I had written some tests on one or two of the functions in there but i check if it was working since the mysql user credentials were different
2020/09/24, 11:38 - JiGsAw: Okay cool 💯
2020/09/24, 11:40 - JiGsAw: To be honest I am even afraid  to change the credentials  on travis to match the lamp server
2020/09/24, 11:43 - +27 62 244 7280: I was thinking of changing the database class or any other function or class that uses the database to include the the credentials when being initialized but that seemed like a longer process since almost all code would need to have that part
2020/09/24, 11:51 - JiGsAw: I think the credentials don't  really  matter that much.

Cause if you were to look at the login file there is some part of code that we leave out(.i.e where you get credentials from the webpage)on github for testing  purposes 
So i don't really think when can be able to make the  files on github  and lamp consistent.
There will always be something that is left out for testing purposes, so I think if someone  were to use the codes they will also need to make sure the credentials point to their database.

I believe  that could  be included  in the read.me file or something  on github
2020/09/24, 12:03 - +27 62 244 7280: Ok fresh, we can make update as the projects continues
2020/09/24, 15:21 - JiGsAw: Jitas. When you write tests now you  can assume  that the tables are exactly  the same as  on lamp server. 
What I mean by this is you do not need to create tables and add values. I have already exported the database from lamp to travis ci 

But the credentials  are still not matching
